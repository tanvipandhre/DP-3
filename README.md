# DP-3

## Problem1: (https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-and-earn/)
* there is nums[] with duplicate numbers. if you delete a num[i] you earn that but you connot choose nums[i]+1 & nums[i]-1 ie they are deleted but not earned
* for this consider a sumarr that has indexes as the numbers in nums[] & contains summation of occurences of those values in nums[].
* deciding factor is only sumarr, so 1-D array.
* similar pattern as House-robber question.

## Problem2 (https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-falling-path-sum/)
* Similar to Paint-House problem but here instead of R, B, G 3 colors we have nXn matrix.
